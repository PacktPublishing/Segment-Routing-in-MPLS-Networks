**Transition from traditional MPLS to SR-MPLS with TI-LFA FRR**

## What is this book about?
This book is a practical guide to learning all about MPLS and SR-MPLS networks, covering key concepts, hands-on labs, and advanced topics, such as fast rerouting (FRR) and TI-LFA for efficient traffic management and network resilience.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Gain a complete understanding of MPLS and its role in network infrastructures
* Develop practical skills to implement SR-MPLS using Cisco IOS-XRv9k and real-life use cases
* Acquire hands-on experience with MPLS networks using the IS-IS and LDP protocols
* Orchestrate the gradual transition from traditional MPLS to SR-MPLS networks and manage their interworking
* Master fast reroute techniques in SR-MPLS networks, including TI-LFA, for efficient traffic rerouting
* Implement path protection methods to ensure network resilience and stability
